YouTube Trending Video Data Analysis 

Trending videos varied every day on different factors including category, view counts,
likes, dislikes, and comments. Therefore, in this project, by using Python and R with relevant
packages on this dataset, we are able to perform numerous statistical models, methods, and other
analysis techniques including Time Series, Multi-Linear models, and Machine Learning to
analyze and predict different trending video features. The analysis of this project will suggest
possible future development of both the Youtube company and Youtubers to create a constructive
video-making and video-sharing platform.

For Youtube:

1. Predict total trending video views daily to monitor company development trends.
2. Simulate the classification algorithm of the Youtube videos category to target
merchants’ potential clients on Youtube and advertise relevant products.

For Youtubers:

3. Visualize the most popular category of trending video to give guidance to new
users on what video to watch/create.
4. Analyze the influencing factors of video views to visualize content feedback and
suggest the direction of improvement for their content.
5. Forecast the life cycle of trending videos to expect how long Youtubers’ video
trends will last.
